Paie API
========

The Paie API calculates all the taxes applicable to a salary in France.

It takes as inputs the description of an employer, an employee and her work hours in a given month, and outputs a breakdown of all applicable taxes, their base and actual value.


Aims
----

Provide an accurate, always up-to-date, detailed breakdown of all taxes applicable to a salary under French law.


Status
------

**The Paie API is currently in discovery stage.**

It is a frequently iterated-over prototype and you should not rely on any parts of its specification.

However, feel free to comment and send feedback or advice at any time. Your input will be useful to direct the following iterations.


Governance
----------

The Paie API is being developed by a State Startup within the French government. Its main aim is to simplify the edition of payslips. It is free open-source software, and you are welcome to contribute to it.
